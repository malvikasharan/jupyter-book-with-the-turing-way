*This setup guide will take you from reading this page online to reading it locally.*

**Using Bash commands on terminal or Jupyter Notebooks**

This tutorial will make use Unix Shell commands that can be run on terminal.
Please refer to the Software Carpentry Shell tutorial if you are new to shell: [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice).

Please note that this tutorial can also be followed by using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Please install a Python distribution that comes with Jupyter Notebooks and Python modules that we will use in the tutorial.
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or its lightweight version, [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found in [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install) and [Miniconda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) respectively.

**Data**

We will use the GitHub repository where all the files including Jupyter Notebooks and example data exist.
Please save the complete repository in your local computer using one the following ways:

- Download the zip file using [this link](https://github.com/jupytercon/2020-jupyterbook-with-turing-way/archive/master.zip), and unzip/extract the files to save locally (for example in your Desktop).

OR,
- Use Git command in your terminal to clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/jupytercon/2020-jupyterbook-with-turing-way.git`

**Launch Jupyter Book**

To start working with Jupyter Notebooks, we need to launch it.
- Please use the [Software Carpentry lesson setup page](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html#option-a-jupyter-notebook) to launch Jupyter Notebooks locally: follow the steps listed only under [*Option A: Jupyter Notebook*](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup/index.html#option-a-jupyter-notebook).
- When you have launched your Jupyter Notebook in your browser, please navigate to the folder `2020-jupyterbook-with-turing-way-master` we downloaded in the previous section. Click to open the file `1-welcome.ipynb` inside `notebooks` folder.
- If you could successfully open this file, you are ready to get started.
